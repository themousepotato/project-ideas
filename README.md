# Collection of ideas for projects

> There could be some opensource tools existing already with similar functionalities. If they get a PR, they would be happy. You'll be happy if they are merging the PR that you've made and by using that functionality. I would be happy if my ideas are getting converted to code. Also, there could be other people with similar ideas. If you're using any idea, please add a link to this repo. I just want to be the user of these tools and be happy ãƒ„

## Academia

### Goodreads-like tool for research papers
For someone pursuing research, it's quite difficult to keep track of the research papers they read and people tend to forget things easily if they aren't documenting their progress efficiently. Since it requires a lot of motivation for doing research, having a cool dashboard and profile will help the students/professors maintain their enthusiasm.  A tool which could do the following would be handy:

1. Scrape information from Google Scholar.
2. Mark research papers as `to read`, `already read`, etc. with time/date info.
3. Write review for research papers.
4. Have a cool profile which containing `top favourite research papers`, `recent reviews`, etc.
5. Highlight content in the papers for future reference. There would be a shelf called `highlights` in the user's profile.
6. Better privacy settings - the user can decide what information goes private and what goes public. For example, they can tag some `highlights` as `private` and some as `public`. This is because some information will be crucial - two consecutive highlights of them might lead to a paper which is probably the one they are working on. Since academia is a competitive field, this functionality is necessary.

Note: I'd seen similar idea in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqDifCJH4uQ) podcast. Credits to [@nishnik](https://github.com/nishnik).

## Gaming

### Memory for DotA
DotA is an awesome game which gives you chills while playing as a team. However, it's really hard for beginners. With patience and good strategy techniques, it's fun to play. For people with bad memory, things would be a little more tough. There are a lot of heroes you can choose and a very few heroes you'll be choosing. There are items which provide some skills to the hero which can be purchased with coins which the hero earns throughout the play and they are crucial in the game. There are a wide variety of them and they have really cool names associated with them. To create a mental model for strategy with other teammates we need to know which item can be purchased and when can we purchase that. So, a tool which takes the input audio of the user and recommend them items which they can buy at that moment. For example, a user can say, "I've 3000 coins, I need more damage and intelligence". Then, they must get item recommendations. It's important to recommend more that one item since it takes some math to calculate the skill level of the hero everytime they buy items.

## Music

### Backing drums for guitar solos
Guitar solos are the best with backing drums especially for genres in metal like djent. It would be great to have a tool for adding drum tracks for guitar solos which plays with the rhythm. However, this functionality can be scaled later to connect any two or more music instruments. This is simply a music collab of the user with their computer.

### Chords/Tabs identifier
If you come across guitar covers on YouTube, you'll see people commenting asking for chords/tabs. For a beginner, it's not easy to identify them by just listening. There are third party apps with hardcoded chords/tabs for each song. But, if we can generate with the input music, that would be more generic and easy. Output image part will be easy to write with SVG once the chords/tabs are identified. This can later be scaled for any music instrument.

## Software engineering

### Mental model for large software systems
Reading and understanding a codebase is a difficult task and it might take months for that. Write a software to output an UML graph which is a mental model to understand and conceptualize large software systems. First versions try to output a static UML graph, but it can be made dynamic later. Requirements: Object Oriented and Modular programming concepts.

## Social media

### Wrapper social media app
Would be great to have a wrapper app that shows posts in all the platforms you're in which could skip muted words, sponsored posts, repetitive posts, recommendations, etc. and shows just the ones you follow. Further, if it could have a plugin store like vscode does where developers can write plugins which can be integrated to the app.
